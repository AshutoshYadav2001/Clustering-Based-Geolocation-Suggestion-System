# Clustering Based Geolocation Suggestion System

# Introduction/Business Problem:

In the fast moving, effort-intense environment that a student inhabits,It’s a frequent occurrence
that one is too tired to fix oneself a home-cooked meal. And of course, even if one gets
home-cooked meals every day, it is not unusual to want to go out for a good meal every once in
a while for social/recreational purposes. Either way, it’s a commonly understood idea that
regardless of where one lives, the food one eats is an important aspect of the lifestyle one
leads.
Now, imagine a scenario where a person has newly moved into a new location. They already
have certain preferences, certain tastes. It would save both the student and the food providers a
lot of hassle if the student lived close to their preferred outlets. Convenience means better
sales, and saved time for the customer.
Food delivery apps aside, managers of restaurant chains and hotels can also leverage this
information. For example, if a manager of a restaurant already knows the demographic of his
current customers, they’d ideally want to open at a location where this demographic is at its
highest concentration, ensuring short commute times to the location and more customers
served.If potential hotel locations are being evaluated, a site that caters to a wide variety of
tastes would be ideal, since one would want every guest to have something to their liking.


Using K-Means Clustering, I found the best accomodation for students in University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES), Deharadun by classifying accomodation for incoming students basis their preferences on amenities, budget and proximity to the college.

# K-means Clustering on Location Data

Three prominent clusters emerged after applying the method on the data:
● Cluster 1(Green) Where both (fruits and vegetables) and (restaurants) are abundant
● Cluster 0(Yellow): Restaurants are plentiful, but groceries less so.
● Cluster 2(Red): Restaurants and groceries are relatively hard to find.


# Discussion

Ideally, students should be maximised at the Green(Cluster 0) locations since both kinds of
students can be catered to there, and obviously, unless renting their own house, it’s very difficult
to open a new housing for just a few students!
Another aspect to think of is cost. One can easily notice, the further away from the college and
the closer to the city centre one gets, the more options one finds for food.The same can be said
about other amenities as well.The closer to the city centre, the more expensive property gets, as
well as the cost of living. Therefore, in reality, Cluster 1 locations might be better value for
money.
Finally, Cluster 2 locations, while not ideal, offer the shortest travel times to college, and may be
viable for students willing to compromise on food or making alternative arrangements. With the
advent of food delivery apps, it is quite easy to get both groceries and prepared meals both, so
there might be a few locations which could be classified as Yellow or Green depending on
coverage.
One thing I would like to note is that the foursquare data seems incomplete; Many locations
seem to be missing or ill-classified. India definitely needs better locational data sets!
